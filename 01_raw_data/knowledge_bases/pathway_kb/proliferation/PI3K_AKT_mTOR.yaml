cell_type_effects:
  CD8_T:
    when_active: PI3K/AKT promotes T cell activation, metabolic reprogramming to glycolysis,
      and effector differentiation. mTOR balances effector vs memory fate.
    behavioral_mapping:
      proliferate: 0.2
      attack: 0.15
      migrate: 0.1
    state_effects:
      activation: 0.2
      metabolic_fitness: 0.15
  Tumor:
    when_active: PI3K/AKT/mTOR is the most frequently activated oncogenic pathway.
      Drives proliferation, survival, metabolic reprogramming, and angiogenesis. PTEN
      loss is common.
    behavioral_mapping:
      proliferate: 0.3
      evade: 0.1
      migrate: 0.1
      apoptosis: -0.2
    state_effects:
      growth_rate: 0.3
      survival: 0.25
      metabolic_activity: 0.2
  Treg:
    when_active: mTOR inhibition favors Treg differentiation. Active PI3K/AKT can
      destabilize FOXP3.
    behavioral_mapping:
      suppress: -0.1
      proliferate: 0.1
    state_effects:
      foxp3_stability: -0.1
      proliferation: 0.1
  Macrophage:
    when_active: PI3K/AKT promotes M2 polarization and anti-inflammatory phenotype.
      mTOR drives metabolic adaptation.
    behavioral_mapping:
      polarize: 0.15
      phagocytose: 0.1
    state_effects:
      m2_polarization: 0.15
      metabolic_fitness: 0.1
  NK:
    when_active: mTOR signaling is essential for NK cell development and cytotoxicity.
      IL-15 activates PI3K/AKT in NK cells.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: 0.15
      proliferate: 0.1
    state_effects:
      cytotoxicity: 0.15
      metabolic_fitness: 0.1
  B_cell:
    when_active: PI3K signaling is essential for B cell development, survival, and
      BCR signaling.
    behavioral_mapping:
      proliferate: 0.15
      signal: 0.1
    state_effects:
      survival: 0.15
