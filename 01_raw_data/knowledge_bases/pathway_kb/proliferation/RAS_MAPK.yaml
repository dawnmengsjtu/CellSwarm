cell_type_effects:
  CD8_T:
    when_active: MAPK/ERK is activated downstream of TCR. Promotes T cell proliferation,
      cytokine production, and effector differentiation.
    behavioral_mapping:
      proliferate: 0.2
      attack: 0.1
      signal: 0.15
    state_effects:
      activation: 0.2
      cytokine_production: 0.15
  Tumor:
    when_active: RAS/MAPK is mutated in ~30% of cancers. KRAS/BRAF mutations drive
      uncontrolled proliferation, survival, and immune evasion.
    behavioral_mapping:
      proliferate: 0.3
      evade: 0.15
      migrate: 0.1
    state_effects:
      growth_rate: 0.3
      immune_evasion: 0.15
  Treg:
    when_active: ERK signaling supports Treg differentiation and FOXP3 expression.
    behavioral_mapping:
      suppress: 0.1
      proliferate: 0.1
    state_effects:
      foxp3_stability: 0.1
  Macrophage:
    when_active: MAPK signaling drives macrophage activation and cytokine production.
      ERK promotes M2, p38/JNK promote M1.
    behavioral_mapping:
      polarize: 0.15
      signal: 0.15
    state_effects:
      cytokine_production: 0.15
  NK:
    when_active: ERK signaling downstream of activating receptors promotes NK cell
      cytotoxicity and degranulation.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: 0.15
    state_effects:
      cytotoxicity: 0.1
      degranulation: 0.1
  B_cell:
    when_active: MAPK/ERK is activated by BCR signaling. Promotes B cell proliferation
      and differentiation.
    behavioral_mapping:
      proliferate: 0.15
      signal: 0.1
    state_effects:
      activation: 0.1
