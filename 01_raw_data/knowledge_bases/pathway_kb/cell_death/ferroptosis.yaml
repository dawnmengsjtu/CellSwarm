cell_type_effects:
  CD8_T:
    when_active: CD8 T cells can induce ferroptosis in tumor cells by secreting IFN-gamma
      which downregulates SLC7A11. T cells themselves are susceptible to lipid peroxidation
      in TME.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: 0.1
      apoptosis: 0.15
      signal: 0.1
    state_effects:
      cytotoxicity: 0.1
      lipid_peroxidation: 0.15
  Tumor:
    when_active: Ferroptosis is a vulnerability in therapy-resistant tumors. GPX4
      inhibition or cystine deprivation triggers iron-dependent death. Mesenchymal-state
      tumors are more susceptible.
    behavioral_mapping:
      apoptosis: 0.35
      proliferate: -0.2
      evade: -0.1
    state_effects:
      survival: -0.3
      lipid_peroxidation: 0.3
  Treg:
    when_active: Tregs are relatively resistant to ferroptosis due to GPX4 expression.
      GPX4 knockout in Tregs paradoxically enhances anti-tumor immunity.
    behavioral_mapping:
      apoptosis: 0.1
      suppress: -0.15
    state_effects:
      suppressive_activity: -0.15
  Macrophage:
    when_active: M1 macrophages promote ferroptosis in tumor cells. Ferroptotic cells
      release DAMPs that activate macrophages.
    behavioral_mapping:
      phagocytose: 0.15
      polarize: 0.1
      signal: 0.1
    state_effects:
      m1_polarization: 0.1
      pro_inflammatory: 0.1
  NK:
    when_active: NK cells are minimally affected by ferroptosis. Can benefit from
      ferroptotic DAMP release.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: 0.05
    state_effects:
      activation: 0.05
  B_cell:
    when_active: B cells have limited direct involvement in ferroptosis pathways.
    behavioral_mapping:
      signal: 0.05
    state_effects:
      activation: 0.05
