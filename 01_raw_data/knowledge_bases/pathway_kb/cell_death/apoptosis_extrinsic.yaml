signal_fields_affected:
- IFN_gamma
cell_type_effects:
  CD8_T:
    when_active: CD8 T cells use FasL and TRAIL to kill target cells. Also susceptible
      to AICD via Fas/FasL.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: 0.2
      apoptosis: 0.1
      signal: 0.1
    state_effects:
      cytotoxicity: 0.2
      aicd_susceptibility: 0.1
  Tumor:
    when_active: Death receptor signaling triggers tumor apoptosis. Tumors often downregulate
      Fas or overexpress FLIP to resist.
    behavioral_mapping:
      apoptosis: 0.3
      evade: -0.1
      proliferate: -0.15
    state_effects:
      survival: -0.25
  Treg:
    when_active: Tregs can kill effector T cells via FasL-mediated apoptosis as a
      suppressive mechanism.
    behavioral_mapping:
      suppress: 0.15
      signal: 0.1
    state_effects:
      suppressive_activity: 0.1
  Macrophage:
    when_active: TRAIL expression on macrophages contributes to tumor cell killing.
      Macrophages clear apoptotic bodies.
    behavioral_mapping:
      phagocytose: 0.15
      signal: 0.1
    state_effects:
      tumoricidal_activity: 0.15
  NK:
    when_active: NK cells express FasL and TRAIL as major killing mechanisms alongside
      perforin/granzyme.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: 0.25
      signal: 0.05
    state_effects:
      cytotoxicity: 0.2
  B_cell:
    when_active: B cells express Fas and are susceptible to FasL-mediated deletion
      during germinal center reactions.
    behavioral_mapping:
      apoptosis: 0.15
    state_effects:
      survival: -0.15
crosstalk:
- pathway: apoptosis_intrinsic
  type: amplifying
  description: Caspase-8 cleaves BID to tBID, amplifying signal through mitochondrial
    pathway
- pathway: TNF_NFKB
  type: competing
  description: TNF-TNFR1 can activate either NF-kB survival or caspase-8 death; FLIP
    determines outcome
- pathway: IFNG_JAK_STAT
  type: synergistic
  description: IFN-gamma upregulates Fas and TRAIL receptors, sensitizing cells to
    extrinsic apoptosis
