signal_fields_affected:
- IFN_gamma
cell_type_effects:
  CD8_T:
    when_active: MHC-I presentation of tumor neoantigens is required for CD8 T cell
      recognition and killing. IFN-gamma upregulates MHC-I.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: 0.25
      signal: 0.1
    state_effects:
      target_recognition: 0.3
      activation: 0.15
  Tumor:
    when_active: Antigen presentation makes tumors visible to T cells. Tumors frequently
      downregulate MHC-I, B2M, or TAP to escape. IFN-gamma can restore expression.
    behavioral_mapping:
      evade: -0.25
      apoptosis: 0.15
    state_effects:
      immunogenicity: 0.3
      immune_visibility: 0.25
  Treg:
    when_active: Tregs are activated by self-antigen presentation on MHC-II. DCs presenting
      self-antigens promote Treg induction.
    behavioral_mapping:
      suppress: 0.1
    state_effects:
      activation: 0.1
  Macrophage:
    when_active: Macrophages are professional APCs. MHC-II presentation activates
      CD4 T cells. Cross-presentation on MHC-I activates CD8 T cells.
    behavioral_mapping:
      signal: 0.25
      phagocytose: 0.1
    state_effects:
      antigen_presentation: 0.3
      apc_function: 0.25
  NK:
    when_active: NK cells kill MHC-I-low targets (missing-self). MHC-I downregulation
      that evades T cells makes tumors NK-susceptible.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: 0.2
    state_effects:
      missing_self_detection: 0.25
  B_cell:
    when_active: B cells present antigens on MHC-II to CD4 T cells, receiving T cell
      help for class switching and affinity maturation.
    behavioral_mapping:
      signal: 0.2
      proliferate: 0.05
    state_effects:
      antigen_presentation: 0.2
      t_cell_help: 0.15
