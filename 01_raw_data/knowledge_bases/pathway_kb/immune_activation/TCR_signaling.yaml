cell_type_effects:
  CD8_T:
    when_active: TCR engagement is the primary activation signal. Strength and duration
      determine effector vs exhaustion fate. Co-stimulation (CD28) required for full
      activation.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: 0.3
      proliferate: 0.25
      signal: 0.2
      migrate: -0.1
    state_effects:
      activation: 0.35
      cytotoxicity: 0.25
      cytokine_production: 0.2
  Tumor:
    when_active: Tumors are targets of TCR-mediated killing. Neoantigen presentation
      determines immunogenicity. MHC-I downregulation enables escape.
    behavioral_mapping:
      apoptosis: 0.2
      evade: 0.15
    state_effects:
      immune_pressure: 0.25
  Treg:
    when_active: TCR signaling is required for Treg activation and suppressive function.
      Tregs recognize self-antigens in TME.
    behavioral_mapping:
      suppress: 0.2
      proliferate: 0.1
    state_effects:
      activation: 0.2
      suppressive_activity: 0.15
  Macrophage:
    when_active: Macrophages present antigens to T cells via MHC-II, initiating TCR
      signaling. Not directly affected by TCR.
    behavioral_mapping:
      signal: 0.1
    state_effects:
      antigen_presentation: 0.1
  NK:
    when_active: NK cells lack TCR. Not directly affected. Benefit from T cell-derived
      cytokines.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: 0.05
    state_effects:
      activation: 0.05
  B_cell:
    when_active: B cells present antigens to T cells and receive T cell help via CD40L.
      TCR signaling indirectly supports B cell responses.
    behavioral_mapping:
      signal: 0.1
      proliferate: 0.05
    state_effects:
      t_cell_help: 0.15
crosstalk:
- pathway: PD1_PDL1
  type: antagonistic
  description: PD-1 recruits SHP2 to dephosphorylate proximal TCR signaling molecules
- pathway: CTLA4_CD28
  type: modulatory
  description: CD28 co-stimulation amplifies TCR signal; CTLA-4 competes to dampen
    it
- pathway: PI3K_AKT_mTOR
  type: downstream
  description: TCR/CD28 activates PI3K, linking antigen recognition to metabolic reprogramming
- pathway: RAS_MAPK
