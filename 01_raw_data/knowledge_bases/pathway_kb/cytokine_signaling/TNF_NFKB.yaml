cell_type_effects:
  CD8_T:
    when_active: TNF co-stimulates T cell activation and promotes effector differentiation.
      NF-kB is essential for T cell survival and cytokine production.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: 0.15
      proliferate: 0.1
      signal: 0.15
      apoptosis: -0.05
    state_effects:
      activation: 0.15
      cytotoxicity: 0.1
  Tumor:
    when_active: Chronic NF-kB activation promotes tumor survival, proliferation,
      and resistance to apoptosis. TNF in TME can paradoxically support tumor growth.
    behavioral_mapping:
      proliferate: 0.15
      evade: 0.1
      apoptosis: -0.15
    state_effects:
      survival: 0.2
      immune_evasion: 0.1
  Treg:
    when_active: TNF-TNFR2 signaling promotes Treg expansion and suppressive function
      in TME.
    behavioral_mapping:
      suppress: 0.15
      proliferate: 0.1
    state_effects:
      suppressive_activity: 0.15
  Macrophage:
    when_active: NF-kB drives M1 polarization, pro-inflammatory cytokine production
      (TNF, IL-1, IL-6). Key for anti-tumor macrophage activation.
    behavioral_mapping:
      polarize: 0.2
      signal: 0.15
      phagocytose: 0.1
    state_effects:
      m1_polarization: 0.25
      pro_inflammatory: 0.2
  NK:
    when_active: TNF enhances NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: 0.15
      signal: 0.1
    state_effects:
      cytotoxicity: 0.1
  B_cell:
    when_active: NF-kB is essential for B cell survival, maturation, and antibody
      class switching.
    behavioral_mapping:
      proliferate: 0.1
      signal: 0.15
    state_effects:
      survival: 0.15
      antibody_secretion: 0.1
