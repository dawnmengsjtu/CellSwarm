cell_type_effects:
  CD8_T:
    when_active: IFN-gamma is the primary effector cytokine of activated CD8+ T cells.
      Autocrine signaling sustains effector function.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: 0.15
      signal: 0.2
    state_effects:
      activation: 0.15
      cytotoxicity: 0.1
  Tumor:
    when_active: 'IFN-gamma has dual effects: direct anti-proliferative/pro-apoptotic,
      but also upregulates PD-L1 (adaptive resistance).'
    behavioral_mapping:
      proliferate: -0.15
      apoptosis: 0.1
      evade: 0.15
    state_effects:
      immune_evasion: 0.15
      apoptosis_susceptibility: 0.1
  Macrophage:
    when_active: IFN-gamma is the canonical M1 polarization signal. Activates iNOS,
      MHC-II, and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
    behavioral_mapping:
      phagocytose: 0.2
      polarize: -0.25
      attack: 0.1
    state_effects:
      polarization: -0.3
  NK:
    when_active: IFN-gamma enhances NK cell cytotoxicity and is a major NK effector
      cytokine.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: 0.15
      signal: 0.15
    state_effects:
      activation: 0.1
  Treg:
    when_active: IFN-gamma can destabilize Treg function under inflammatory conditions.
    behavioral_mapping:
      suppress: -0.1
    state_effects:
      suppressive_activity: -0.1
  B_cell:
    when_active: IFN-gamma promotes B cell class switching to IgG2a.
    behavioral_mapping:
      signal: 0.1
    state_effects:
      activation: 0.05
