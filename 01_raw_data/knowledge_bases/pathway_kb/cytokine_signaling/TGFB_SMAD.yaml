cell_type_effects:
  CD8_T:
    when_active: TGF-beta suppresses CD8+ T cell effector function, inhibits proliferation,
      and promotes tissue-resident memory phenotype.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: -0.25
      proliferate: -0.2
      rest: 0.2
      migrate: -0.15
    state_effects:
      activation: -0.2
      cytotoxicity: -0.2
      exhaustion: 0.1
  Tumor:
    when_active: 'TGF-beta has dual roles: tumor suppressor early (growth arrest)
      but promoter late (EMT, invasion, immune evasion).'
    behavioral_mapping:
      migrate: 0.2
      evade: 0.2
      proliferate: -0.1
    state_effects:
      immune_evasion: 0.25
  Treg:
    when_active: TGF-beta is essential for induced Treg differentiation (iTreg) and
      maintains FOXP3 expression.
    behavioral_mapping:
      suppress: 0.3
      signal: 0.1
    state_effects:
      suppressive_activity: 0.25
      activation: 0.1
  Macrophage:
    when_active: TGF-beta promotes M2 polarization and suppresses pro-inflammatory
      functions.
    behavioral_mapping:
      polarize: 0.25
      phagocytose: -0.1
    state_effects:
      polarization: 0.25
  NK:
    when_active: TGF-beta strongly suppresses NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: -0.3
      signal: -0.15
    state_effects:
      cytotoxicity: -0.25
      activation: -0.2
  B_cell:
    when_active: TGF-beta promotes IgA class switching and inhibits B cell proliferation.
    behavioral_mapping:
      proliferate: -0.1
      signal: 0.05
    state_effects:
      activation: -0.1
