  key_genes:
  - TIGIT
  - CD226
  - PVR
  - NECTIN2
signal_fields_affected:
- PD_L1
cell_type_effects:
  CD8_T:
    when_active: TIGIT competes with CD226 for PVR binding, delivering inhibitory
      signals. Suppresses T cell effector function.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: -0.2
      proliferate: -0.1
      rest: 0.15
    state_effects:
      exhaustion: 0.1
      cytotoxicity: -0.15
  NK:
    when_active: TIGIT is a major NK cell checkpoint. Engagement reduces NK cytotoxicity
      and IFN-gamma production.
    behavioral_mapping:
      attack: -0.25
      signal: -0.15
    state_effects:
      cytotoxicity: -0.2
      activation: -0.15
  Treg:
    when_active: TIGIT+ Tregs are highly suppressive and produce IL-10 and fibrinogen-like
      protein 2.
    behavioral_mapping:
      suppress: 0.2
    state_effects:
      suppressive_activity: 0.15
  Tumor:
    when_active: Tumor PVR expression engages TIGIT on immune cells, promoting immune
      evasion.
    behavioral_mapping:
      evade: 0.15
    state_effects:
      immune_evasion: 0.1
  Macrophage:

crosstalk:
- pathway: PD1_PDL1
  type: synergistic_inhibition
  description: TIGIT and PD-1 co-expression marks terminally exhausted T cells; dual
    blockade shows synergy
- pathway: CTLA4_CD28
  type: parallel_inhibition
  description: Both are co-inhibitory receptors but act through distinct ligand systems
