% Abstract

Agent-based models of the tumor microenvironment (TME) traditionally rely on hand-coded rules that cannot generalize beyond their programmed logic. Here we present \cellswarm{}, a framework that replaces rule-based cell decision-making with large language model (LLM)-driven autonomous agents. Each simulated cell maintains persistent state, 14 signal pathways, and a memory stream, with an LLM serving as its cognitive core. Using structured knowledge bases for cancer-specific context, \cellswarm{} recapitulates TNBC microenvironment composition with fidelity comparable to hand-coded rules (Jensen--Shannon divergence 0.144 vs.\ 0.146; $P = 0.012$ vs.\ random, Mann--Whitney $U$ test). Beyond matching rule-based performance, LLM-driven agents demonstrate three capabilities absent from rule-based models: cross-cancer generalization by swapping knowledge base entries, treatment response prediction concordant with clinical data (anti-PD-1: 17.6\% simulated vs.\ 21\% clinical), and sensing of indirect genetic perturbations that propagate through intermediate signaling cascades (IFN-$\gamma$ KO: Agent $+$15.7\% vs.\ Rules $+$0.3\%; $P = 0.005$). \cellswarm{} demonstrates that LLM-driven cell agents can recapitulate and extend TME simulation beyond the reach of hand-coded rules.
